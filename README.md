Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository

Project Summary

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find additional information about the variables in the Codebook.md file.
